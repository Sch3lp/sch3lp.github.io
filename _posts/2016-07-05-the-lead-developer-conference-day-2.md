## The Lead Developer - continued
The Lead Developer conference, or at least the one I went to, was held on the 23rd and 24th of June 2016, in the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in London, during the _Brexit_ vote.

## Day 2<a name="Day_2">&nbsp;</a>

### Michael Lopp - Leadership by the numbers<a name="Michael_Lopp">&nbsp;</a>
So Michael Lopp, [@rands](http://twitter.com/@rands), is a guy with a HUGE amount of knowledge. I'm very glad he was so generous to share with us.

He guided his talk somewhat weird and I didn't fully understand what the stuff he was saying had to do with _Leadership by the numbers_, but the content was great.

He started off by testing the skills of the people that were captioning the entire conference by saying out loud _Ok I gotta test this real quick... Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious_. After the word appeared after 1-2 seconds, the crowd went wild. :) 

These guys really did do an amazing job. I found myself checking to see what was said when some of the presenters went a bit fast for me to keep up with my notes. So thanks again guys!

#### Team Communications
I would be jealous to be in his team, because @Rands takes 30 minutes every week, no matter what, to have a 1 on 1 meeting with every member of his team. Just to check in, and have a feeling of what's actually going on that week with his team. In contrast to the _Performance Evaluation_ timeslots everyone dreads because it feels so forced.

He also has _staff starting points_, little 1 hour meetings to set the tone for the week. If you can't easily fill an hour, something is wrong.

He then started talking about the long term costs of not saying the hard thing at the right time. 

The obvious cost is that when you don't say something, work isn't getting done, team morale is taking a hit (and more importantly the toxicity spreads), and your sanity takes a hit as well.

The less obvious cost is that your credibility as a leader is taking a hit, and that there's impact on folks you do not know. **Their** sanity is taking a hit. Michael has learned that _everyone is replaceable._. I learned that when you work for Michael, Rands, or whatever his name is, and he shows you a slide of corn, you're about to get fired.

#### Diversity, delegation and leading by example
Again, _Diversity_ made an appearance on stage. This time in the form of the [_Asch Conformity Experiments_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments), where the experiment shows that you can easily get influenced by other people. Again, be aware of the bias that you probably hire people like you and that wanting a diverse team is a _no brainer_. And also that as leaders, we should be a diversity allies.

This phrase fired a bunch of neurons in my brain _You set tone and cadence... **all the time**_. Just like kids who watch you do stuff and repeat your actions you do subconsciously. He gave an example of his own daughter using redirection to a new game she saw at games convention E3, when she saw him enter her room all ready to lecture her. He realized that she learned that from him.

As an easy change, you could simply start and finish meetings on time, and show you respect peoples time. This can set the tone for the whole company to do the same.

Watch his complete talk when it's released to find out what you might be _horrifically bad_ at, and how you might direct yourself to a path of learning how to become better at it. 

Also delegate when you're in a stressy situations (e.g. the site is down). You know how to do it so let someone else do it and learn. Another great quote: 
> Delegation is a great way to grow a team.

#### Be unfailingly kind
He finished with a bit that hit home for me.

He talked about how he plays the videogame _Destiny_, an online shooter where you need to finish missions with a (random _P_ick_ _U_p) _G_roup. Since there's a huge variation of skilled people online, you're lucky if everyone knows what to do and knows their role. And a lot of frustration and toxicity can originate from these situations.

But he plays this game with a friend who is _Unfailingly Kind_. It doesn't matter how toxic other players are, or how little they know about the game. This friend has a lot of patience.

This was such a recognizable situation to me, and I strongly believe in being this _Unfailingly Kind_ guy. But it's really difficult to always be like this. I've got MAD respect for Michaels friend. And I'll do my best to help people out in the friendliest way possible again.

Great keynote to start off Day 2 if you ask me. The _tone_ was set again.

### Ryan Alexander - Hacking verbal communication systems<a name="Ryan_Alexander">&nbsp;</a>
Ryan ([@RNAlexander](http://twitter.com/@RNAlexander)) Alexander took us on a deep dive into conversation.

I learned that a group conversation or brainstorming session is like a race. Where everyone that's trying to talk next is at a starting line, holding their positions, waiting for the starter flare to go off (the one talking to stop talking).

But that there might be people in the conversation that follow the rules, waiting in their position. And that there are others that don't, leaving the rest behind, before the starter flare was even fired.

This is sort of a semi-conscious, complex algorithm going on in every participants head. And exactly because it's an algorithm, we can hack it.

I never thought about discussions or conversations like this, but it makes **SO** much sense.

Then I learned about the _Occupy Together_ hand signals. Where you can announce your intent, without interrupting, to the participants in the conversation. Click the image for a clarifying explanation, or watch Ryans talk when it gets released.

Seems like this would work WAY better than a simple "speech token".

To facilitate everyone getting their chance to speak/communicate, the hand signals are more friendly to neurodiverse individuals. Moreover you can decide who's next to talk on the basis of whether or not they have spoken, this is called _Progressive Stack_.

Great little talk with a boat load of information. Definitely worth your time!

### Yan Cui - Tour of language landscape<a name="Yan_Cui">&nbsp;</a>
I'm sorry I didn't write down all that much in my notes about the stuff that Yan Cui ([@theburningmonk](http://twitter.com/@theburningmonk)) taught us. But it's because as I was sitting in the audience, it soon became apparent that this talk was gonna be a ridiculously interesting one and it would deserve my full attention.

Here's the stuff I'm able to recollect though.

After a short introduction on the impact of language on the way we think, he showcased some really excellent examples of how features in certain programming languages can make your code more expressive. He took a bunch of features of `F#`, `Clojure`, `Rust` and `Idris` and explained how they could make your code less error prone and more expressive at the same time.

If you're in to [DDD's Ubiquitous Language](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html), there's no doubt that you should watch this talk. Even if you have 0 experience with the languages Yan mentions.

He closes off his talk by encouraging everyone that didn't know the programming languages he mentioned. He did this through debunking Malcolm Gladwell's ["10,000 hours to master something" rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)), with [Josh Kaufmans correction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY) that says you can already be "good" at something after the first 20 hours.

Really, interesting talk, hitting all the stuff I love. Would **highly** recommend.

If you're not into watching a presentation, [read](http://theburningmonk.com/2015/04/dont-learn-a-syntax-learn-to-change-the-way-you-think/).

This guy is a library of himself!

Yan Cui, if you're reading this: Thank you!

### Crystal Huff - Dealing with Impostor syndrome<a name="Crystal_Huff">&nbsp;</a>
Crystal ([@crystalhmhuff](http://twitter.com/@crystalhmhuff)) replaced another presenter at the last minute, and her presentation was very interesting nonetheless.

_Impostor Syndrome_ is not a disease, unlike the term suggests, but rather a state in which you think you feel underqualified but when in reality you're really not.

It can have real consequences such as being less effective as collaborators (because nobody wants to be seen making a mistake), getting fewer promotions (because an impostor feels unworthy), etc. In the end the negative impact comes down to being marginalized and being silenced.

It gets fed by sentiments like _Fake it until you make it_, when if successful, you actually will have been an imposter. Other things that feed into it are phrases like _Women are bad at math_. Even worse is when you give in to those stereotypes where you say for example _Math is hard, let's go shopping_.

Other important, notable things that might trigger it are comparing your worst snapshot to someone elses best snapshot, and the _Being Liked vs. Being Competetent_ dichotomy.

There are ways of combatting it though. And as usual it involves gaining more awareness. For example by asking your colleagues or friends about your strengths. Or by realizing your heroes struggle with this as well, and picturing _the iceberg (illusion) of success_.

[![Just the tip]({{site.url}}/public/assets/2016-07-05-the-lead-developer-conference-day-2/the-iceberg-illusion.jpg)](https://plus.google.com/+SylviaDuckworth/posts/fjVw5ZFs1Cb)

Preventing _Impostor Syndrome_ involves watching out for certain things that you say e.g. _I'm not an expert, but..._. If you repeat that phrase often enough, you'll eventually believe it.

Compare yourself with yourself. Compare your past self (on your own personal scale of where you want to be in life), to your current and future self. Instead of comparing snapshots of your _worst self_ to snapshots of somebody elses _best self_. This made a lot of sense, but it's something you just need to hear more.

Crystal also inspired us to help each other prevent it by critiquing with kindness. Compliments are better when they're personal. A good compliment is positive, not physical, specific, and honest. See [Dan North's "How to make a sandwich"](/2016/06/29/the-lead-developer-conference-day-1/#Dan_North) presentation about feedback.
When you notice someone else struggling with impostor syndrome, help them remind themselves of their happy thoughts and experiences.

I did reach out via the company Slack channel for someone to tell me 3 awesome things about me and here's what I got.

> You speak your mind, even to people you don't know that well.
> You're not scared (you don't show it at least) to try out new things.
> When you're enthusiastic about something, you shine your ray of enthusiasm onto other people. (you pull them along)

So thanks for helping me combat _Impostor Syndrome_!
