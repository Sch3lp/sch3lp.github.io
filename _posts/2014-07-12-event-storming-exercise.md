As I'm currently in between projects at [Cegeka](http://www.cegeka.be) and I just finished working on an RFP.
I got to factor in a day of learning along with other developers yesterday.
And boy oh boy was it worthwile.

## Event Storming

Last year at Vaughn Vernon's ([@VaughnVernon](http://twitter.com/VaughnVernon)) 3-day Implementing DDD course, there was a part where Alberto Brandolini ([@ziobrando](http://twitter.com/ziobrando)) gave a workshop on what he called "Event Storming". Over the year the term has gotten some attention [here](http://ziobrando.blogspot.be/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html#.U8GUcPmSzIU) and [there](http://verraes.net/2013/08/facilitating-event-storming/). There's even a twitter account made: [@EventStorming](https://twitter.com/eventstorming).

Most recently though, Alberto gave a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/ziobrando/event-storming-recipes) about it at the DDD Exchange conference in London.

## Preface

The idea to get together and practice EventStorming ourselves came from [Jo Vanthournout](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jovanthournout), one of our more avid DDD practitioners. The project he's on at the moment had a mandatory holiday. And what better way to fill it up with learning than to organize an EventStorming practice session with colleagues. After some interest on our social enterprise he booked a room, brought post-its and sharpies and we were good to go.

The idea was to try and *storm* the tabletop game ["Friday"](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43570/friday).

In this blog post I'll list all of the stuff we noticed during our day of learning, so it might a be a bit TMI. :)

## Alberto's Event Storming Recipes

We all first watched Alberto's presentation that he gave on the DDDX conference.

### Pausing and discussing is awesome!
