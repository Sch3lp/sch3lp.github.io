An experiment in which I try to balance out my life according to my values, by first of all making the values and how much I've spent time on them, in relation to each other.

## Why?
Because my past-self needs to make my future-self aware of how things are standing, so I can appropriately prioritize certain actions.

## Yeah but why though?
Because apparently my persona can't do it on his own, and there's no real feeling of necessity until it's too late.

## How do you make it visible?
Started off like this: ![](life-balance-scale/beginning.jpg).

With all things equal.

## How did you decide on your values?
Added first things that came to mind, that I might not spend enough time on, or that I know for a fact I spend time on.

## Adding _Work_ to the scale

## Orientation
Values in columns (me) vs. values in rows (my mom).

Columns: "infinite height", because I don't know how high some values might become.
Rows: "no infinite height", because it sooner gets limited by available wall space.
