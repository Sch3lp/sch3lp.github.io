## What is the Responsibility Process?

[Christopher Avery](http://twitter.com/ChristopherAver), did a bunch of research and eventually came up with his [Responsibility Process](http://www.christopheravery.com/responsibility-process). Watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T3IZ2ISxag) too.

In short, it explains how responsibility is not to be considered a trait, something you inherit, but rather something of a state machine, or something that evolves through phases. This process as laid out by Christopher, provides you with a framework that eventually allows you to become aware of which state/phase you're in, and act upon it as to achieve the goal of Responsibility.

Getting there means you will be able to answer to the inner question that is "What do I really want".

Through practice, I found this Process to be extremely powerful. An effect which its simplicity would make you think otherwise.
If there's one resolution you should fulfill in 2015 it's this one, to use the [Responsibility Process](http://www.christopheravery.com/responsibility-process) and become a better, happier person.

## What does it have to do with Retrospectives?

The [Responsibility Process](http://www.christopheravery.com/responsibility-process) is more applicable on a personal level. But make no mistake, it's very powerful on a team level as well.
Providing the answer to the team's question of "What do WE really want?" is generally a difficult endeavor. However, with the knowledge of the [Responsibility Process](http://www.christopheravery.com/responsibility-process) in the back of everyones mind, can make it realistically achievable.

How do we get this into the back of everyones mind? You build a Retrospective around it!

### The goal

To do better in the next [iteration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration#Project_management).

### How to achieve it

Get everyone in the team to understand the [Responsibility Process](http://www.christopheravery.com/responsibility-process) framework, thereby creating a sort of hivemind, allowing your team to align itself and make decisions easy to take.

### What you'll need

* A meeting room
* Post-its
* Markers for everyone
* Sticky (or non-sticky) Flip-charts, Paper-roll, ... A clean surface area
* Tape

Draw out the phases of the [Responsibility Process](http://www.christopheravery.com/responsibility-process) on the clean surface area.
Leave some room in between the lanes.

### Setting the stage

Make sure you mention [Norm Kerths Prime Directive](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PrimingPrimeDirective.html), especially if this is your first retro, but also as a refresher.
[Pick one](http://www.plans-for-retrospectives.com/?id=1-2-3-18-22-31-32-36-42-43-46-52-59-70-76-81-82-84-85-90). The internet is a vast ocean of possibilities.

### Gathering Data

1. Briefly explain the [Responsibility Process](http://www.christopheravery.com/responsibility-process). Give short examples for all the phases.
2. Have everybody write down on a post-it - in silence - at least one event or experience in the past iteration that they can remember, whether it be a good or bad one.
3. Then have everybody try and hang each of their post-its on the Responsibility Process.

If you have a big team, or you're doing a project retro, chances are you'll get a WHOLE lot of post-its. If this is likely the case, you might want to limit the amount of post-its that people can write. You can just lay down a hard limit of 2-3 per person, or constrain them in another way (add to comment section if you have a nice example).

### Generate Insights

This is the most important part of your retro. Because here we want the people in the team to become aware of what phase they were in when they experienced their chosen event.

Start with Denial or Blame, and read the post-its out loud. Move up the phases as you go along.

Try to put it every post-it you pick up in the phase where the team thinks it actually belongs. If it isn't clear what the writer meant by it, have them explain it.

Group same post-its ONLY when they are both about the same subject AND in the same phase!

### Analysis

After you finished all the post-its, note how many are in which phase. This is the phase you are most likely to improve on as a team. The usual thing goes as well where you note clusters of subjects. It might be not as apparent because different post-its on same subjects might be spread out in different phases. This is ok. It's more important to learn where in the states you are, then which subjects pop out. By saying them out loud, everybody will notice it anyways.

### Things to look out for

* Confusing Lay Blame with Justify. Justify is really about outside/external actions that are completely out of your hand, but also are almost completely unchangeable. e.g. The sun comes up at dawn and it only woke me up when the light came in my bedroom, that's why I was late. In contrast to: my partner was supposed to set my alarm, but forgot about it, that's why I was late. 
* 

### Decide what to do

Ask the team the big question: "What do WE really want?". You can then proceed to dot-vote, or merge, or make SMART goals.
Suggest that you can organize a contest where teammembers publicly keep their "Hits & Misses" of the phase that had the biggest amount of post-its.
On a whiteboard or whatever, list the teammembers, a hits column and a misses column. When a person noticed that they were in a certain phase when they said/did something, they can mark it as "hit". If they notice it after they said/did something or someone else notices it afterwards, it counts as a "miss".
This might work against you if some teammembers are likely to "game the system". It's fun to then ask them from what phase in the [Responsibility Process](http://www.christopheravery.com/responsibility-process) they're acting the way they are. :)

### Closing the retro

Explain the concept of Team Responsibility, which you sort of hinted at already in the previous section. This time make it really explicit that it's you as a team that also can move through the different phases.

Again, [pick one](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com/?id=14-15-16-17-23-34-40-44-45-53-57-60-67-71-77-83-92).
If you're like me, you're going to want to choose one that give you, the facilitator, feedback on how you ran your retro and how they felt during.
